            <h2>Basic Buttons</h2>
            <p>I wanted to basic button to have different hover states show the diversity of characters in DC Comics.
                The company is more well known for their characters rather than their brand.</p>
            <p>The characters I chose were Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman. This is because they are the most well
                characters in the DC universe. The hover states represents their villain counterparts.</p>

            <h2>Toggle</h2>
            <p>Based on the character Shazam, when the user clicks on the UI, the slider transform into the Shazam.</p>
            <p>I wanted to keep the change simple while also showcasing as many DC characters as I possibility can.</p>

                <h2>Slider</h2>
                <p>Based on the character Firestorm, as the slider moves, the fire on his head gets larger</p>
                <p>I do think that the head feels out of place compared to the other UI. The fire getting taller makes
                    it
                    harder to place to the UI that’s high up on the screen.</p>

                <h2>Double Slider</h2>
                <p>Based on the character Firestorm, the sliders can be used as both a range slider and a regular
                    slider.
                    The character Firestorm is made of two people and combing them to transform a double slider into a
                    regular slider was an interesting idea.</p>
                <p>I do think that the default states should be more generic to fit in wit the other UI elements.</p>

            <h2 class="multiselect">Multi Selector</h2>
            <p>Inspired by DC’s always changing branding, I wanted to allow the user to choose between each era.</p>
            <p>One thing that could be improved would be to show how the UI interacts the other UI on screen. This
                element is decently big and I’m worried about how reusable it is.</p>

                <h2>Radio Button</h2>
                <p>Based on the character Cyborg, I like the idea of his uses of BOOM tubes as a potential hover state,
                    His
                    logo was in the shape of a radio button, making him the perfect fit.</p>
                <p>The states and animations have to be keep simple since these UI elements are so information heavy.

            <div class="checkbox">
                <h2>Checkbox</h2>
                <p>Based on the character Darkseid, his Omega beams had great potential to be used as a hover state. His
                    logo was also simple and a similar color to Cyborg’s, that it group these elements with each other
                    nicely.</p>
                <p>The states and animations were kept simple since these UI elements are also really information heavy.

        <div class="InteractionSection Toolbar">
            <h2 class="tool1">Toolbar</h2>
            <p>Based on the characters from the Green Lanturn series, each icon represents one of the lanturn corps.
                Text was placed under the icons to make it easier to understand where each icon will lead the user.</p>
            <p>In hindsight, the icons might have been too unusual which may make it harder for the user to navigate.

            <h2>Menu</h2>
            <p>Since this will be information heavy, I wanted to keep the design simple and subtle. The only thing that
                will be embellished is the hover states.</p>

            <h2>Big Button</h2>
            <p>The big button will be similar to the basic button at the start for consistency purposes. I wanted it to
                act as the gateway to DC Comic world.</p>

    <div class="InteractionSection Progress_Wait">
        <div>
            <h2 class="progress">Progress Bar</h2>
            <p>Based on the character Flash, the progress bar shows the character running to get to the Speed Force. To
                indicate the progress bar speeding up or slowing down, the character will change how he runs.</p>

        <div class="wait">
            <h2 class="wait1">Wait Indicator</h2>
            <p>Using the current DC logo, the Wait indicator takes inspiration from comic’s use of halftones. By combing
                that idea with an LED design, it keeps the indicator simple enough to not be too distracting but also
                interesting enough to notice.</p>
            <p>The logo was used to enforce the branding since the wait indicator will be used a lot through out the UI.
            </p>
